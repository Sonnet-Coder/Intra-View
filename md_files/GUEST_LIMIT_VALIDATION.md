# Guest Limit Validation Feature

## Overview
Added guest limit validation when users attempt to join an event using an invite code. The system now checks if the event has reached its maximum capacity before allowing new guests to join.

## Problem Solved
Previously, users could join events even when the maximum guest limit was reached. This could lead to:
- Events being overcrowded beyond the host's planned capacity
- Poor user experience (guests joining only to find the event is actually full)
- Logistical issues for the host

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Guest Limit Check Logic
The validation is performed in `HomeViewModel.joinEventWithCode()` method:

```kotlin
// Check guest limit before allowing new guest to join
val currentGuestCount = event.guestIds.size
val maxGuests = event.maxGuests

if (maxGuests != null && currentGuestCount >= maxGuests) {
    Log.w(TAG, "Event is full: $currentGuestCount/$maxGuests guests")
    _error.value = "Event is full! Maximum capacity of $maxGuests guests reached."
    _isJoiningEvent.value = false
    return null
}
```

### Validation Flow

```
User enters invite code
        ↓
Find event by code
        ↓
Event found? → No → "Invalid invite code"
        ↓ Yes
User is host? → Yes → "You are the host"
        ↓ No
Already a guest? → Yes → Navigate to event
        ↓ No
Check guest limit ← NEW VALIDATION!
        ↓
Has maxGuests limit?
        ↓ Yes
Current guests >= maxGuests?
        ↓ Yes → ERROR: "Event is full!"
        ↓ No
Add user to event ✓
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `HomeViewModel.kt`
**Location:** Line 145-156
**Changes:** Added guest limit validation before adding user to event

```kotlin
// Check guest limit before allowing new guest to join
val currentGuestCount = event.guestIds.size
val maxGuests = event.maxGuests

if (maxGuests != null && currentGuestCount >= maxGuests) {
    Log.w(TAG, "Event is full: $currentGuestCount/$maxGuests guests")
    _error.value = "Event is full! Maximum capacity of $maxGuests guests reached."
    _isJoiningEvent.value = false
    return null
}

Log.d(TAG, "Guest limit check passed: $currentGuestCount/${maxGuests ?: "No Limit"} guests")
```

#### 2. `strings.xml`
**Added new error messages:**
```xml
<string name="event_full">Event is full! Maximum capacity reached.</string>
<string name="event_full_with_count">Event is full! Maximum capacity of %d guests reached.</string>
```

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Event with Guest Limit (e.g., 50 guests)
1. **Event Setup:**
   - Host creates event with maxGuests = 50
   - Current guests = 48

2. **Guest 49 tries to join:**
   - ✅ Check: 48 < 50 (passes)
   - ✅ Guest successfully joins
   - Current guests = 49

3. **Guest 50 tries to join:**
   - ✅ Check: 49 < 50 (passes)
   - ✅ Guest successfully joins
   - Current guests = 50

4. **Guest 51 tries to join:**
   - ❌ Check: 50 >= 50 (fails)
   - ❌ Error displayed: "Event is full! Maximum capacity of 50 guests reached."
   - ❌ Guest cannot join

### Scenario 2: Event with "No Limit"
1. **Event Setup:**
   - Host creates event with maxGuests = null
   - Current guests = 1000

2. **Any guest tries to join:**
   - ✅ Check: maxGuests is null (skipped)
   - ✅ Guest successfully joins
   - No limit enforced

### Scenario 3: Guest Already Joined
1. **Guest tries to join again:**
   - ✅ Check: Already has invitation
   - ✅ Navigate to event (no error)
   - Guest count doesn't increase

## Error Message Display

### User Experience:
When a guest tries to join a full event:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Enter Invite Code         │
│                             │
│   [ABC123_________]         │
│                             │
│   ⚠️ Event is full!         │
│   Maximum capacity of       │
│   50 guests reached.        │
│                             │
│   [Cancel]  [Join Event]    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

The error message:
- Appears in a red-tinted error container
- Shows the exact guest limit
- Prevents the join button from working
- User friendly and clear

## Logging

The system logs all validation steps for debugging:

```
D/HomeViewModel: Attempting to join event with code: ABC123
D/HomeViewModel: Found event: Birthday Party (event123)
D/HomeViewModel: Current user ID: user456
D/HomeViewModel: Guest limit check passed: 48/50 guests
D/HomeViewModel: Adding user to event's guest list
D/HomeViewModel: Successfully joined event
```

If event is full:
```
D/HomeViewModel: Attempting to join event with code: ABC123
D/HomeViewModel: Found event: Birthday Party (event123)
W/HomeViewModel: Event is full: 50/50 guests
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. ✅ No Guest Limit (null)
- Validation is skipped
- Any number of guests can join

### 2. ✅ Guest Limit = 0
- No one can join (technically full)
- Only host can be in event

### 3. ✅ Already a Guest
- Check happens BEFORE limit validation
- Existing guests can always access event
- Doesn't consume an additional slot

### 4. ✅ Host Trying to Join
- Check happens BEFORE limit validation
- Shows appropriate error message
- Host cannot join their own event as guest

### 5. ✅ Race Condition
- Guest limit check uses current event state
- If multiple users try to join simultaneously:
  - Firestore handles atomic operations
  - First successful addition wins
  - Subsequent attempts will see updated count

## Validation Order (Important!)

The checks happen in this specific order:

1. ✅ **Invite code valid?**
2. ✅ **User authenticated?**
3. ✅ **User is host?** (reject)
4. ✅ **User already a guest?** (allow access, skip limit check)
5. ✅ **Guest limit reached?** ← NEW CHECK
6. ✅ **Add user to event**
7. ✅ **Create invitation**

This order ensures:
- Existing guests aren't blocked
- Validation is efficient
- Error messages are appropriate

## Benefits

### For Hosts:
- ✅ Event capacity is respected
- ✅ No overcrowding issues
- ✅ Better event planning and management
- ✅ Can see current/max guest count in real-time

### For Guests:
- ✅ Clear error message if event is full
- ✅ No wasted effort trying to join
- ✅ Immediate feedback
- ✅ Can try other events

### For System:
- ✅ Data integrity maintained
- ✅ Firestore operations optimized
- ✅ Proper logging for debugging
- ✅ Clean error handling

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Join Event Under Limit
```
Given: Event with maxGuests = 10, current = 5
When: User joins with valid code
Then: User successfully joins, current = 6
```

### Test Case 2: Join Event At Limit
```
Given: Event with maxGuests = 10, current = 10
When: User joins with valid code
Then: Error "Event is full! Maximum capacity of 10 guests reached."
```

### Test Case 3: Join Event With No Limit
```
Given: Event with maxGuests = null, current = 100
When: User joins with valid code
Then: User successfully joins, current = 101
```

### Test Case 4: Existing Guest Rejoins Full Event
```
Given: Event with maxGuests = 10, current = 10
And: User is already a guest
When: User enters invite code again
Then: User accesses event (no error)
```

### Test Case 5: Host Creates Event With Limit 0
```
Given: Event with maxGuests = 0, current = 0
When: User joins with valid code
Then: Error "Event is full! Maximum capacity of 0 guests reached."
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. Waiting List Feature
- Allow guests to join waiting list when event is full
- Notify waiting guests when slots become available

### 2. Grace Period
- Allow slight overbooking (e.g., +10%)
- Useful for events where some guests might not show up

### 3. Priority Access
- VIP guests can join even when full
- Implement guest priority levels

### 4. Dynamic Limit Adjustment
- Host can increase limit later
- Notify waiting guests automatically

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - All changes compile without errors!

## Summary
The guest limit validation feature ensures that events respect their maximum capacity. Users receive clear, immediate feedback when attempting to join full events, improving the overall user experience and helping hosts manage their events effectively.
