# Fixed: Join Event Button Not Responding

## Problem
When a user enters an invite code and clicks "Join Event", nothing happens. The button doesn't respond and the user is not added to the event.

## Root Cause
The `joinEventWithCode()` method in `HomeViewModel` was only **finding** the event by invite code but was **not adding the user as a guest** to the event. The `addGuestToEvent()` repository method existed but was never called.

```kotlin
// BEFORE (incomplete implementation):
suspend fun joinEventWithCode(): Event? {
    val code = _inviteCode.value
    if (code.isBlank()) return null
    
    return eventRepository.findEventByInviteCode(code)  // Only finds, doesn't join!
}
```

## Solution
Updated the join flow to:
1. Validate the invite code
2. Find the event by invite code
3. **Add the current user as a guest to the event**
4. Handle all edge cases (invalid code, already joined, user is host, etc.)
5. Show proper loading states and error messages

## Changes Made

### 1. **HomeViewModel.kt** - Added Loading State
```kotlin
private val _isJoiningEvent = MutableStateFlow(false)
val isJoiningEvent: StateFlow<Boolean> = _isJoiningEvent.asStateFlow()
```

### 2. **HomeViewModel.kt** - Complete Implementation
```kotlin
suspend fun joinEventWithCode(): Event? {
    val code = _inviteCode.value
    if (code.isBlank()) {
        _error.value = "Please enter an invite code"
        return null
    }
    
    _isJoiningEvent.value = true
    _error.value = null
    
    // Find event by code
    val event = eventRepository.findEventByInviteCode(code)
    
    if (event == null) {
        _error.value = "Invalid invite code"
        _isJoiningEvent.value = false
        return null
    }
    
    // Get current user
    val userId = authRepository.currentUserId
    if (userId == null) {
        _error.value = "User not authenticated"
        _isJoiningEvent.value = false
        return null
    }
    
    // Check if user is the host
    if (event.hostId == userId) {
        _error.value = "You are the host of this event"
        _isJoiningEvent.value = false
        return null
    }
    
    // Check if already a guest
    if (event.guestIds.contains(userId)) {
        _isJoiningEvent.value = false
        return event  // Already joined, just navigate
    }
    
    // Add user as guest (THIS WAS MISSING!)
    val result = eventRepository.addGuestToEvent(event.eventId, userId)
    
    _isJoiningEvent.value = false
    
    if (result is Result.Error) {
        _error.value = result.message
        return null
    }
    
    return event
}
```

### 3. **HomeScreen.kt** - Enhanced UI with Feedback
- Added loading state collection
- Added error state collection
- Updated dialog to show:
  - Loading indicator while joining
  - Error messages if join fails
  - Disabled inputs during loading

## User Flow Now

1. User clicks FAB (+ button) on home screen
2. Dialog opens with invite code input field
3. User enters invite code (e.g., "ABC123")
4. User clicks "Join Event" button
5. **Loading state shows**: "Joining event..." with spinner
6. System validates code and adds user as guest
7. **On success**: Dialog closes, user navigates to event detail
8. **On error**: Error message shows (e.g., "Invalid invite code")

## Error Handling

The system now handles:
- ✅ Empty invite code → "Please enter an invite code"
- ✅ Invalid invite code → "Invalid invite code"
- ✅ User not authenticated → "User not authenticated"
- ✅ User is host → "You are the host of this event"
- ✅ Already joined → Silently navigates to event
- ✅ Database errors → Shows specific error message

## Testing Steps

1. **Test valid invite code:**
   - Enter valid code → Should join successfully ✅
   
2. **Test invalid invite code:**
   - Enter "INVALID123" → Should show error ✅
   
3. **Test empty code:**
   - Click join without entering code → Should show error ✅
   
4. **Test joining own event:**
   - Use invite code from your own event → Should show error ✅
   
5. **Test joining already joined event:**
   - Use code for event you're already in → Should navigate ✅

## Technical Details

- Uses `EventRepository.addGuestToEvent()` to add user to event's `guestIds` array
- Firebase Firestore uses `FieldValue.arrayUnion()` to prevent duplicates
- Loading state prevents multiple simultaneous join attempts
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Real-time event updates via Firestore listeners show newly joined events
