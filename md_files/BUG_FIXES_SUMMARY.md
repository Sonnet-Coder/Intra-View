# Bug Fixes Summary - QR Code and Guest Count Issues

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: QR Code Not Showing for Guests After Joining Event

**Problem:**
- When a user joined an event using an invite code, they could not see their QR code on the "My QR" screen
- The screen would show "No invitation found" even after successfully joining

**Root Cause:**
The `HomeViewModel.joinEventWithCode()` method was only adding the user to the event's `guestIds` array but was **NOT creating an Invitation record** in Firestore. The QR code generation requires an Invitation record with a `qrToken`.

**Code Flow That Was Broken:**
1. User enters invite code → `HomeViewModel.joinEventWithCode()`
2. Only called `eventRepository.addGuestToEvent()` (adds userId to event.guestIds)
3. No Invitation created ❌
4. User navigates to QR screen → `QRViewModel.loadEventAndInvitation()`
5. Calls `invitationRepository.getMyInvitationForEvent()` → returns null
6. No QR token available, no QR code generated

**Fix Applied:**
Modified `HomeViewModel.joinEventWithCode()` to:
1. Check if invitation already exists
2. Add user to event's guest list
3. **Create an Invitation record** with a unique QR token
4. Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/main/java/com/eventapp/intraview/ui/screens/home/HomeViewModel.kt`
  - Added `InvitationRepository` dependency
  - Modified `joinEventWithCode()` to create invitation
  - Added debug logging

### Issue 2: Guest Count Showing 0 and View All Button Not Responding

**Problem:**
- The event detail screen showed "Guests (0)" even when users had joined
- Clicking "View All" button did nothing

**Root Cause:**
Two separate issues:
1. **Data Mismatch**: The EventCard shows `event.guestIds.size` but EventDetailScreen shows `invitations.size`. Since invitations weren't being created, the invitations list was empty.
2. **Missing Click Handler**: The "View All" button had an empty comment `/* Navigate to guests list */` instead of actual functionality.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Fixed the underlying data issue by ensuring invitations are created (Issue 1 fix)
2. Added debug logging to the "View All" button to track the discrepancy between `invitations.size` and `guestIds.size`
3. Added TODO comment for implementing a proper guest list screen

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/main/java/com/eventapp/intraview/ui/screens/event/EventDetailScreen.kt`
  - Added Log import
  - Added click handler with debugging for "View All" button

### Issue 3: Improved Error Handling and User Feedback

**Additional Improvements:**

**QRViewModel:**
- Added comprehensive logging to track invitation loading
- Added error state when invitation is not found
- Provides clear error message to user

**QRDisplayScreen:**
- Enhanced error display with helpful message
- Added "Go Back" button when invitation is not found
- Better user guidance ("Please try rejoining the event")

**EventDetailViewModel:**
- Added detailed logging for event loading
- Logs invitation count and details
- Helps diagnose data sync issues

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/src/main/java/com/eventapp/intraview/ui/screens/qr/QRViewModel.kt`
- `/app/src/main/java/com/eventapp/intraview/ui/screens/qr/QRDisplayScreen.kt`
- `/app/src/main/java/com/eventapp/intraview/ui/screens/event/EventDetailViewModel.kt`

## Testing Instructions

### To Test QR Code Fix:
1. Sign out and sign back in
2. From home screen, tap the FAB (+) button
3. Enter a valid event invite code
4. Join the event
5. Tap on the event card
6. Tap "My QR" button
7. **Expected**: QR code should now be visible with event details

### To Monitor Debug Logs:
Filter logcat by the following tags:
- `HomeViewModel` - Shows join event flow and invitation creation
- `QRViewModel` - Shows invitation loading and QR generation
- `EventDetailViewModel` - Shows invitation count and data sync
- `EventDetailScreen` - Shows guest count debugging

### Example Log Output on Successful Join:
```
D/HomeViewModel: Attempting to join event with code: ABC123
D/HomeViewModel: Found event: Birthday Party (eventId123)
D/HomeViewModel: Current user ID: userId123
D/HomeViewModel: Adding user to event's guest list
D/HomeViewModel: Creating invitation for user
D/HomeViewModel: Successfully created invitation with QR token: qrToken123
D/HomeViewModel: Successfully joined event
```

### Example Log Output on QR Screen:
```
D/QRViewModel: Loading event and invitation for eventId: eventId123
D/QRViewModel: Event loaded: Birthday Party
D/QRViewModel: Invitation found for event. QR Token: qrToken123, CheckedIn: false
D/QRViewModel: QR code generated successfully
```

### Example Log Output on Event Detail:
```
D/EventDetailViewModel: Loading event details for eventId: eventId123
D/EventDetailViewModel: Event updated: Birthday Party, guestIds count: 5
D/EventDetailViewModel: Invitations updated: 5 invitation(s) found
D/EventDetailViewModel:   Invitation 0: userId=user1, checkedIn=false
D/EventDetailViewModel:   Invitation 1: userId=user2, checkedIn=true
...
```

## Data Integrity Notes

### For Existing Users:
Users who joined events **before this fix** will still not have Invitation records. They have two options:
1. **Leave and rejoin** the event (if the app has leave functionality)
2. **Manual database fix**: Create Invitation records manually in Firestore for existing guests

### For New Users:
All new users joining events will automatically get:
- Entry in `events/{eventId}/guestIds` array
- New document in `invitations` collection with unique QR token

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Migration Script**: Create a one-time migration to generate invitations for existing guests who don't have them
2. **Guest List Screen**: Implement a dedicated screen to view all guests (currently just has TODO)
3. **Invitation Status**: Add visual indicators for invitation status (pending, accepted, declined)
4. **Error Recovery**: Add "Regenerate QR Code" button if invitation loading fails
5. **Offline Support**: Cache invitation data for offline QR code display
